description: Generate a PRP file from an INITIAL.md spec
arguments:
  - name: feature_spec_path
    description: Path to INITIAL.md
response_length: short

{% set feature_name = (feature_spec_path | basename | replace('.md', '')) %}

### 🔍 Step 1 – Load the feature request
Read `{{feature_spec_path}}` to understand the desired functionality, examples,
docs, and constraints.  
Extract:
- **Feature summary** (one sentence)
- Bullet list of **functional requirements**
- Bullet list of **non‑functional / constraints**

### 🗂 Step 2 – Code‑base reconnaissance
Search `src/` for related modules, helper patterns, and test utilities that
should be reused.  Include file paths and short summaries (≤ 1 line each).

### 🌐 Step 3 – External research hooks
If external docs or libraries are referenced in the feature file, embed the
exact URLs so another agent can click through.

### 📝 Step 4 – Write the PRP
Create `PRPs/{{feature_name}}.md` with the following sections:

1. **Context** – copy/paste the bullet lists from Steps 1–3.
2. **Implementation blueprint** – ordered task list:
   - file(s) to create or modify
   - algorithm / API design notes
   - error‑handling patterns
3. **Validation gates** – commands that *must* pass:  
   ```bash
   ruff check --fix
   pytest -q
   ```
4. **Done checklist** – items the implementer must tick.
At the very end score "Confidence to succeed in one pass: X/10".
